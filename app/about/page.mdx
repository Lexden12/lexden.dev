# Alex "Lexden" Schendel

Hello! My name is Alex and I am a Firmware Engineer by day and a gamer/DiYer by night.

The projects page has a list of the projects I am working/have worked on.

This whole site is still very much a WIP, and being a firmware engineer who is used to working in the backend low-level stuff, front-end web dev is certainly outside of my wheelhouse, so please feel free to submit feedback on this website's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Lexden12/lexden.dev).
