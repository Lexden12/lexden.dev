# Air Quality Meter

The goal of this project is to build an air quality meter for use in the home. It provides identical capabilities to the [Air Lab](https://networkedartifacts.com/airlab/) but at a lower cost by going DiY.
The overall sensor suite and MCU are identical, but instead of having a display and battery, this device is intended to be powered over USB and send data to a server over WiFi for logging and visualization.
Overall, my BoM currently includes:
- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html) (microcontroller with WiFi)
- [Adafruit SCD-41](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5190) (CO2, temperature, and relative humidity sensor)
- [Adafruit LPS22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4633) (barometric pressure and temperature sensor)
- [seeedstudio Grove SGP-41](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Air-Quality-Sensor-SGP41-p-5687.html) (VOC and NOx sensor)
Optional:
- [Adafruit OLED Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2674) (for local readout)

I have the MCU and OLED, and I have purchased the Adafruit sensors. The SGP-41 is sourced from Seeed Studio rather than Adafruit because Adafruit only has the SGP-40, which cannot measure NOx levels.

The OLED display is listed there because I happened to have it lying around and it makes for a nice way to view the data offline. I have purchased an eInk display however, because I will be keeping this in my bedroom where I do not want bright lights at night.

In preparation, I have started working on the firmware using the Arduino framework, leveraging existing libraries for each sensor. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lexden12/AirQuality).
