# Air Quality Meter

The goal of this project is to build an air quality meter for use in the home. It provides identical capabilities to the [Air Lab](https://networkedartifacts.com/airlab/) but at a lower cost by going DiY.
The overall sensor suite and MCU are identical, but instead of having a display and battery, this device is intended to be powered over USB and send data to a server over WiFi for logging and visualization.
Overall, my BoM currently includes:
- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html) (microcontroller with WiFi)
- [Adafruit SCD-41](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5190) (CO2, temperature, humidity sensor)
- [Adafruit LPS22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4633) (barometric pressure sensor)
- [Adafruit SGP-40](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4829) (volatile organic compounds sensor)
Optional:
- [Adafruit PMSA003I](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4505) (particulate matter sensor)

I have the MCU and I plan to purchase the sensors soon. One note is that the SGP-40 is not identical to the SGP-41 used in the Air Lab. This would result in my version being unable to measure NOx levels, so I am not buying this yet and may look for an alternative sensor in the future.
