  <p class="text-light mx-3">Hello! My name is Alex and I am a Server Firmware Engineer by day and a gamer/DiYer by night.<br>
  The projects dropdown has a list of the projects I am working/have worked on. <br>
  This whole site is still very much a WIP, and being a firmware engineer who is used to working in the backend, low-level stuff, front-end web dev is certainly outside of my wheelhouse, so please feel free to submit feedback on this website's <a href="https://github.com/Lexden12/lexden.dev" target="_blank">GitHub repo!</a><br>
